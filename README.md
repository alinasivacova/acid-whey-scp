# acid-whey-scp  
PhD research repository on acid whey valorisation and yeast-based single-cell protein production.

---

## Overview  
This repository contains materials, data, protocols and analytical workflows related to the doctoral research project focused on:

- Biotechnological valorisation of acid whey
- Yeast-based single-cell protein (SCP) production
- Fermentation strategies using lactose-hydrolysed substrates
- Bioprocess optimisation and analytical characterisation
- Scaling considerations (TRL progression)

The project is carried out within the Food Science doctoral programme at the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies (LBTU).

## Repository Structure  
The repository will gradually include the following sections:

    /data               → raw and processed fermentation and analytical data  
    /protocols          → laboratory protocols, workflows, experimental setups  
    /analysis           → Jupyter notebooks, calculations, growth models  
    /methods            → descriptions of analytical and bioprocessing methods  
    /literature         → reference lists, notes, reading summaries  
    /figures            → diagrams, plots, visualisations  

A structured folder architecture ensures reproducibility and transparency of the research workflow.

## Research Focus  
The project aims to:

1. Evaluate acid whey as a substrate for yeast biomass formation.  
2. Investigate growth performance of selected yeasts on lactose and hydrolysed lactose substrates.  
3. Assess the nutritional and biochemical composition of produced SCP.  
4. Optimise the fermentation process for maximum biomass and protein yield.  
5. Integrate analytical chemistry tools for precise characterisation.  
6. Develop a scalable concept for industry in alignment with TRL targets.
